# PacMan

This is a PacMan project that I worked on while taking the online MITxPro class for Full Stack Web Development in 2022. 

PacMan will move across the screen as his mouth opens and closes. When PacMan reaches the border of the Page he will reverse direction and continue his pursuit. 

PacMan can be initialized with a click. PacMan's journey begins! Enjoy!
